#Project Description:

The Lease Management System is a Salesforce-based application designed to streamline and automate the entire lifecycle of lease management for real estate or asset-based businesses. The system provides a centralized platform to manage lease agreements, track leased assets, monitor payments, and generate lease-related reports.

The project leverages Salesforce’s robust features such as custom objects, Lightning components, workflow automation, and Apex triggers to offer a scalable and efficient solution catering to landlords, property managers, and corporate leasing teams.
